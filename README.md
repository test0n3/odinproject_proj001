# The Odin Project - Foundations

## Project: Recipes

Content/description evaluating knowledge about HTML.

### Assignment

#### Iteration 1: Initial structure

1. Within the *odin-recipes* directory, create an *index.html* file.
2. Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an *h1* heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.


#### Iteration 2: Recipe Page

1. Create a new directory within the *odin-recipes* directory and name it *recipes*.
2. Create a new HTML file within the *recipes* directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example *lasagna.html*. You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration, you can [find a recipe to use here](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
3. For now, just include an *h1* heading with the recipe’s name as its content.
4. Back in the *index.html* file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. The text of the link should again be the recipe name.


#### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

The recipe page should have the following content:

1. An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on google or the site [recipe site](https://www.allrecipes.com/) we linked to earlier.
2. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
3. Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an **unordered list** of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
4. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an **ordered list** of the steps needed for making the dish.


#### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

1. Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
2. Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.


### Viewing your project on the web

If you want to show your work (the project) to others, or submit a solution below, you will need to publish your site so that others can access it from the web, rather than just on your local machine. The good news is that if you have your project on GitHub (as described above), doing this is incredibly simple.

GitHub allows you to publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository. Doing this will allow you to access your project from *your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name.*

There are a couple of ways to go about doing this, but the simplest is this:

- make sure that the main HTML file of your project is called *index.html*. If it is not, you will need to rename it.
- go to your GitHub repo on the web and click the **Settings** button.
- click on **Pages** on the left side bar.
- change the **Source** from none to main branch and click Save.
- it may take a few minutes (the GitHub website says up to 10) but your project should be accessible over the web from *your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name* (obviously substituting your own details in the link).
